<h2>So what has popped up in your mind? Tell me...</h2>



<div class="justify"><p>She took her mug of coffee and went to stand next to the window.
 It was quiet outside, only the raindrops were making noise on top of the roof of the house.
 She stood momentarily, thinking of how the Drazen people lost. It was simple, 
just before the flowers finished blooming, their hero was taken from life, never
 to witness the beauty of summer again. She nodded her head, as she also felt it, the
 force which brought her to the sea full of emotions. Justice was supposed to 
be given to the Drazen people because they wanted answers,
 in order to know how their hero met the fate of dying by a bullet.</p>

<p>Such was simple death to a man like Menzi Mabuyani.
The mug of coffee on her hand was still at half level and 
it was slowly getting
 cold as she forgot it. The matters of a foreign land were
 stimulating an unknown energy to her. She wanted to dive
 deeper on the mystery of Menzi’s death. Even though she was born
 outside Drazen land, the fact that she spent most of her life traveling
 across the nodes and antinodes of the Drazen as journalist, made her feel she
 was rightful to mourn for the hero which she also viewed as hers.
 And, because years back, she acquired her masters in law at the University of Sunyview, 
she was going to bring justice to the citizens.</p></div>

<div class="para">
<p>Her name was Thandiwe Xolo. She was on her early thirties and lived her 
life in an Island which was surrounded by the waters which also surrounded 
the Drazen land. She was very stubborn in what she believed in. Many adored her 
charisma and it was what brought courage and confidence into her.
She put her mug of coffee onto the table and without giving a thought,
 she was focused into her laptop. “Many emails!” she surprised and thrilled forward to read each and every emails.
 Menzi’s burial was after two days from that day.</p>

<p  class="paraa">As a lady who believed everything happens for a reason, she opened her book note and 
looked at the notes she jotted the moment the region received news on Menzi’s death.
 Everything seemed twisted to her. Lisa Koko was already behind the bars, even though
 the reason was not stated. They just arrested her from the scene, the moment she gained consciousness.
 After that, nothing was whispered about her, 
she was a ghost to the police like she had no life before meeting Menzi.</p></div>


<div  class="paraa">
<p>She allowed thoughts to vacate her from reality but she forgot nothing
 was going to bring her back from reality so soon. 
Thandiwe Xolo was confused on whom to defend, the hero
 or Lisa Koko who still behind bars whilst pregnant. 
She kept quiet for minutes like she was digestion may thoughts in her brain.
 Her eyes wheeled across the displays of her certificates of achievements and
 merits, she smiled and from that, she knew what to do as she believed she was born to give others justice.</p>


 <p  class="paraa">She wasn’t going to show her side of defence because everything seemed blur in the eyes of her thoughts.
A call which took snatched her from the disturbed state made her smile as her father 
reminded her of her birthday. She surprised and asked herself of how she forgot her birthday.
 The smiles were over her cheeks as she logged into another google account on her laptop.
 It was when she so many notifications of her birthday wishes.
 From that, she knew that meant a celebration because her friends were
 not going to just let the day pass.</p></div>

<p  class="para">She stood up and went straight to the kitchen to spill 
her coffee into the sink and washed her cup.
 After that, she was already laying on the Jacuzzi playing with the bubbles like a child.
 Bubble bath was her favourite when she was distressed and that moment it was the best to
 her despite the thought that it was her thirty first birthday. 
After bathing, she applied make up to her brown skin and comb her
 charcoal her before she fit herself into long side open grey dress.
 She the watched herself onto the mirror, standing on top of her heels
 while wearing her shiney silver earings. For a second she rehearsed her
 smiles before she was going to meet her friends and family. It was obvious, everyone
 was was gathered there for the party and she wasn’t going to disappoint them by her flopped mood.
She then packed her clothes and necessary thing because she knew, she was not going to come back
 early in her apartment. It was going to take her time because after her party 
she was driving to Drazen City. When she was done preparing, she took her travelling 
bag and purse and went to put them into her car. She went back into the house to check 
if everything was left in order and all was well arranged in the house. She locked it 
and went into her car. Her compass led her to her parent’s house where the party was going to take place.</p>
